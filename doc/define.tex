The first line consists of the element name and the atom count $m$, separated by space.
Following this are $ N_1 + N_2 + \dots + N_m $ lines, each containing l numbers.
The first three numbers represent the atomic coordinates, while the remaining l-3 numbers represent the parameters of that specific atom.
Subsequently, there are $ 3*(N_1 + N_2 + \dots + N_m) $ lines, each defining $a_n$ sequential parameter, represented by an integer sequence a where each $ a_i $ denotes the i-th preceding atom.
These atoms are oriented in different directions concerning other atoms.
Lastly, the file extension name is \(''\).xcl\(''\)
